I can't count the number of times I have been asked to write a project method statement. I have written many, but I have never been able to find a template that I liked. So, I decided to create my own. This is a template for a project method statement that can be used for any project. It is based on the principles of the PRINCE2 methodology and can be adapted to suit your needs.
