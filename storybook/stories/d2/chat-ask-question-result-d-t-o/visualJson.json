These countries have a significant presence in the global banana market and are known for their large-scale banana plantations.\n By targeting these regions, Banana4All aims to address the ecological impact of banana production in areas where it is most prevalent. These countries have a high concentration of banana farms and play a crucial role in supplying bananas to international markets.\n However, it is important to note that while the project's initial focus may be on Latin America, its principles and strategies can be adapted and implemented in other banana-growing regions worldwide. The ultimate goal of Banana4All is to bring about positive change and sustainability to the banana industry on a global scale."
