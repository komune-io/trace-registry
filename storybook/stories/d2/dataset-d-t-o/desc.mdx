## Dataset

Type: `DatasetDTO`

dcat:Dataset represents a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent or identifiable community. The notion of dataset in DCAT is broad and inclusive, with the intention of accommodating resource types arising from all communities. Data comes in many forms including numbers, text, pixels, imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be collected into a dataset.
