# Evidence

Type: `EvidenceDTO`

Proof that a Requirement is met.



The class Evidence provides the means to support responses to Criteria or to a concrete Information Requirement or to an Information Concept inside an Information Requirement. The proof described by an Evidence can: <br/>1 verify a claim (i.e. is it true that John is 25, yes/no),<br/>2 prove a condition (i.e. is John 18+, yes/no), or <br/>3 simply provide data (i.e. the age of a person, namely 25). The proof can be given through documents or extracts of base registries, independently of its structure, format or medium used to exchange it: a pdf document, a video, a recording, etc.
