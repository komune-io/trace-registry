# Evidence Type



An EvidenceType represents the type of evidence used to support a requirement or information. It provides a categorization mechanism to differentiate between the different forms of evidence that can be used to support a requirement, such as test results, documentation, certification, or expert judgment. <br/> See https://semiceu.github.io/CCCEV/releases/2.00/#Evidence%20Type
