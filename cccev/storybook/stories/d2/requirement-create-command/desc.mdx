### Command

Type: `RequirementCreateCommand`

---

***identifier*** `String?`

A custom identifier for the requirement



---

***kind*** [`RequirementKind`](#requirementkind)

Subtype used for the requirement.



---

***name*** `String?`

Name of the requirement.



---

***description*** `String?`

Description of the requirement. <br/> If the requirement is a constraint, this field must contain an expression returning a boolean. For now, this expression will be evaluated using a Kotlin engine. <br /> The expression may contain known information concepts, identified by their id. They must be declared in the `hasConcept` field.



---

***hasRequirement*** [`List<RequirementId>`](#requirementid)

Sub-requirements that must be fulfilled for the requirement to be validated.



---

***isRequirementOf*** [`List<RequirementId>?`](#requirementid)

A reference between a sub-Requirement and its parent Requirement. The relation between a parent Requirement and a sub-Requirement can be complex. Therefore, qualified relations (see `hasQualifiedRelation`) can be used to represent this relationship on its own and qualify it with additional information such as a date, a place. This is left to implementers. In the case where the purpose is to link the two Requirements without additional information, the simple relationship as proposed here can be directly used.



---

***hasQualifiedRelation*** [`List<RequirementId>?`](#requirementid)

Described and/or categorised relation to another Requirement. <br/> This property leaves the possiblity to define a qualified relation from Requirement to Information Requirement or Constraint as well as a qualified relation from Requirement to Requirement. A use case would be to specialize an EU requirement in Member States' specific requirements.



---

***hasConcept*** [`List<InformationConceptId>`](/docs/core-information-concept--page#informationconceptid)

Concepts used by the requirement



---

***hasEvidenceTypeList*** [`List<EvidenceTypeListId>`](/docs/evidencetypeid--page#evidencetypeid)

Evidences that must be provided for the requirement to be validated. <br/> This list represents an OR-relation, i.e. only one of the specified evidence lists has to be fully provided.
